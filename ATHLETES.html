				<p>Muhammad Ali (Boxer)</p>
				The Louisville Lip talked the talk and walked the walk, being a part
				 of some of the greatest boxing matches of the last century.  
				 Outside of the ring he remained larger than life, speaking out for 
				 civil rights and against the Vietnam War, even threwing his Olympic 
				 Gold Medal into the Ohio River after being refused service at a 
				 'whites only' restaurant.

				<p>Jesse Owens (Track Athlete)</p>
				The story of Jesse Owens is one of historical timing, as an outstanding
				 young athlete he reached his full sporting potential at the time of
				 the 1936 Olympics.  The Olympics happened to take place in pre-war 
				 Berlin and were hijacked by Adolf Hitler to propel his Nazi Propaganda.
				 The sight of a black athlete winning four gold medals hit at the core 
				 of his crazed Aryan ideology.

				<p>The life of a jockey is pretty tough, and the sporting life of Bob was
				 made harder when diagnosed with cancer.  He battled against the illness
				 to comeback and win the 1981 Grand National on his horse Aldaniti who
				 itself had recovered from a career threatening injury.

				<p>Williams Sisters (Tennis)</p>
				<p>Ok, so sneakily I’ve put them under one person, but with the list a bit
				 male dominated it needs some balance.   Their father is criticized for 
				 some of the practices used to propel them to stardom, but that shouldn't
				 detract from their huge achievement of rising to the top of what was 
				 historically a white, middle class dominated sport.  Their father was 
				 by no means poor,  but choose to move his family to the LA projects.  
				 His reasoning was to provide them with a tougher upbringing with which
				 to create their hunger for success.

				 of world football.  He played a part in the re-emergence of soccer 
				 in the USA and now serves as an ambassador for British sport supporting
				 the London Olympic bid for 2012.

				<P>
				LA Lakers superstar basketball player Magic faced incredible prejudice
				 when diagnosed  with HIV in 1991.  Forced to retire whilst at the peak
				 of his career he returned to the game, only to be forced out again until
				 coming back for a successful third shot.  After his final retirement he
				 became a prolific campaigner, aiming to educate people about HIV discrimination.
