				<p>U2</p>
					<p>
					Bono has spearheaded one of the world’s most famous bands for the past 39 years.
					 U2 are undoubtedly one of the most influential rock bands of our time, and continue
					 to put out music that rivals anything else out there.
					 </p>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>

		<img src="images/hendrix.jpg"class="imgLeft">
				<p>JIMI HENDRIX</p>
					<p> Potentially the greatest guitar hero to ever walk the planet, Jimi Hendrix is the
					 true definition of an icon and has changed the way we look at (not to mention hear)
					 music, forever.
					 </p>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>

				<p>BOB DYLAN</P>
					<p> After 5 decades in the game, there’s no doubting the genius that is Bob Dylan. 
					He’s been on his Never Ending Tour since the late 80s, which without even going into
					 his musical achievements is enough alone to impress us…  
					</p>
					<br></br>	
		<img src="images/bob_marley.jpg"class="imgLeft">
				<P>BOB MARLEY</P>	
					<p>Without a doubt one of the most incredible, passionate and inspirational musicians 
					to have graced us with his presence, there’s absolutely no doubt that Bob Marley 
					continues to be one of the most important artists in the world.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
		 <img src="images/michael_jackson.jpg"class="imgLeft">
				<P>MICHAELJACKSON</P>
					<p>Surely being the King of Pop sums up Michael Jackson’s influence in one fail swoop?
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
		 <img src="images/queen.jpg"class="imgLeft">
				<P>QUEEN</P>
					<p>What makes Queen one of the most influential (and successful) bands in the world is 
					that they truly loved (and explored) music. Thom Yorke of Radiohead even bought a 
					guitar because he was so in awe of Brian May. Enough said?
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
		 <img src="images/madonna.jpg"class="imgLeft">
				<P>MADONNA</P>
					<p>Madonna has always been, and continues to be, one of the most important figures in music.
					She’s been cited an inspiration by almost every female (and a fair share of male) artist 
					in existence. And who could forget that John Paul Gautier outfit?
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
		 <img src="images/ELVIS2.jpg"class="imgLeft">
				<P>ELVIS PRESLEY</P>
					<p>There’s a whole chapel in Vegas named after him, he’s written some of the most well-known 
					songs of all time, his nickname is Elvis the Pelvis. We could go on, but it’s safe to say
					he continues to influences hundreds of thousands of people daily.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
		 <img src="images/sexpistols.jpg"class="imgLeft">
				<p>SEX PISTOLS</P>
					<p>Controversy is one of the things that made Sex Pistols as influential as they are – and it’s 
					something that we hardly see in music today. Johnny Rotten genuinely did not care what anyone 
					thought or said; he wrote the music that he wanted to and he did it well.
					</p>
					<br></br>
					<br></br>
		 <img src="images/johnlennon.jpg"class="imgLeft">
				<P>JOHN LENNON</P>
					<p>Last but not least, we bring you the incredible, world-renowned John Lennon. There’s almost
					too much to write about the way that this man influenced music. Go right now and listen to 
					literally any song by The Beatles and we guarantee you’ll find that something you’ve listened 
					to recently has been influenced by it.
