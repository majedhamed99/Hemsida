			<p> Bill Gates</p>
			<p>
				The man who founded Microsoft and helped make personal computing
				 accessible to the masses quickly became the wealthiest man in the
				 world (although that title no longer belongs to him). In addition
				 to pioneering own computer software, he established the Bill and 
				 Melinda Gates Foundation to help alleviate poverty in developing 
				 countries. Today the Gates Foundation is the largest private 
				 foundation in the United States and has been a part of significant
				 healthcare initiatives, including the eradication of polio.

			<p> Marie Curie</p>
				Marie Curie was one of the most noteworthy female scientists in 
				 history.She discovered radiation, which became crucial in X-ray technology,
				 cancer treatments, and many other aspects of healthcare today.
				 Curie won the Nobel Prize for her work, an accolade that was rarely
				 awarded to a woman. Sadly, she was not aware of the dangers of 
				 radiation and died from exposure to it.

			<p>Benjamin Franklin</p>
			<p>
				Benjamin Franklin, whose image is seen on the one-hundred dollar bill,
				was one of the Founding Fathers and an all-around genius. He wrote an
				 almanac for farmers that accurately predicted future weather patterns
				 (Poor Richard's Almanac) and helped discover electricity. Benjamin 
				 Franklin also invented bifocals and the Franklin Stove.

			<p> Julius Caesar</p>
			<p>
				The first Roman emperor, Julius Caesar transformed Rome from a 
				republic into an empire. He expanded its military might while 
				promoting virtue among Roman citizens, believing that the realm 
				would be upheld through Roman families. He usurped for himself 
				many of the powers and privileges that had previously belonged 
				to the Senate, and along the way, he earned himself a good many 
				enemies. Even his friends turned on him, and they stabbed him to
				 death on the Ides of March.

			<p>Abraham Lincoln</p>
			<p>
				Born into dire poverty in Illinois, Abraham Lincoln would rise 
				to become one of the most important figures in American, and world,
				 history. He was elected to the Senate before becoming President of 
				 the United States, just before the Civil War broke out. In his 
				 Emancipation Proclamation, he declared that slavery was no longer a
				 valid institution and all slaves were free. He was assassinated 
				 shortly before the war ended, but his legacy is impossible to 
				 understate.

			<p>Mahatma Gandhi</p>
			<p>
				Born into India while it was under the British colonial government,
				 Mahatma Gandhi became a leader in the independence movement. 
				 He advocated nonviolent resistance as a means to not only end British
				 rule but also to create a new Indian nation. After India gained 
				 independence in 1947, he worked tirelessly to promote peace with the 
				 newly-partitioned state of Pakistan. He was assassinated by a Hindu 
				 nationalist who disapproved of his work with Pakistani Muslims.
				 Today, he is known as the Father of India.

			<p>Martin Luther King, Jr </p>
			<p>
				The Civil Rights leader was also a Baptist pastor in Alabama. 
				Martin Luther King, Jr. organized nonviolent resistance movements,
				 including the Montgomery Bus Boycott after Rosa Parks was arrested 
				 for not giving up her seat to a white passenger. He went on to help 
				 organize the March on Washington, where he gave his famous "I Have a 
				 Dream" speech. A white supremacist assassinated him, but his efforts 
				 were ultimately successful.

			<p>Isaac Newton</p>
			<p>
				Isaac Newton is probably most famous for his discovery of gravity, 
				which explains both why things fall to earth and why planets stay in 
				orbit around the sun. When he needed to make measurements that 
				involved a form of math that didn't exist, he invented a new branch 
				of math: calculus. He wrote down many of his discoveries in a book 
				called Principia, which is still considered a masterpiece.

			<p>Albert Einstein</p>
			<p>
				Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who emigrated to the United
				 States and remained there after Hitler rose to power in his native 
				 Germany. He discovered general relativity, then supplemented it with
				 special relativity to fill in some of the gaps. Einstein also studied
				 things like the photoelectric effect, which helped form the basis for
				 quantum physics. During World War II, he was recruited for the Manhattan
				 Project so that he could help develop the technology for the atomic bomb.
